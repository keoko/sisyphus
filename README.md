- backoffice to manage configuration
- logging

# hierarchical keys
prd/oms/default.edn
prd/oms/HH/default.edn
prd/oms/HH/jobs.edn

### DONE
- different configurations by environment

### NICE TO HAVE
- stored files in EDN or YAML
- show historical data
- yada: missing some documentation

### DOUBTS
- how to debug web app - logging?
- how to autoreload clojure system after a change?

- how to store the general config? replicated in all branches? how to keep them sync?
- how flexible are hierarchical keys?
