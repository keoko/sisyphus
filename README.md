# sisyphus

Central configuration system.

## Installation

lein run

## Usage

curl http://localhost:3000/<environment>/<key>/<subkey>/...

curl http://localhost:3000/dev/A/B


## TODO
- store data in git repository. 1 repo per app-environment (being on the same repo, branch, or different repos).
- sort file strategy (by name?)
- store data in YAML, useful for the pull-mode
- return data in YAML
- logging
- security (authentication OAuth?)
- backoffice to manage configuration
- concurrency issues http://akazlou.com/posts/2015-12-12-small-experiment-git-ds.html
- configurable repositories


## hierarchical keys

prd/oms/default.edn
prd/oms/payments.edn
prd/oms/HH/default.edn
prd/oms/HH/jobs.edn
prd/oms/HH/EU/UK/default.edn


## Emacs
- bind mac copy, paste keys
- block selection
- magit
- clj-refactor
- how to autocomplete in emacs (autocomplete)
- how to jump to clj functions (imenu)


## Features
- different configuration by environment (development, staging, production).
- hierarchical keys (e.g. A, A/B, A/B/C).
- optional config validation.


## NICE TO HAVE
- key definition in Schema
- git repo security
- interesting hybrid model (push with gitconsul and pull REST)
- metrics
- schema coercion
- stored files in EDN or YAML
- show historical data
- yada: missing some documentation
- unit/integration/acceptance testing
- server caching strategy
- client UI to manage and store data
- caching strategy (HTTP HEAD, etc)
- versioning: use git tags, or git hash numbers to retrieve specific versions. Not so sure, it's so useful, as you would usually be interested on the latest changes. If it's rarely used, it could be implemented just cloning a repo, just for that case. It would take more time.
- Datomic as data store.

## DOUBTS
- 1 repo per environment vs all environments in 1 repo?
- how to pull files in git repo wihout concurrency issues
- how to debug web app - logging?
- how to autoreload clojure system after a change?
- how to sync config and schema?
- how to store the general config? replicated in all branches? how to keep them sync?
- how flexible are hierarchical keys?
- does it make sense to expose API to fine grained keys?
- how to change configuration? git clients? special UI?
- can we build UI from schema definition?
