# sisyphus

Central configuration system.

## Installation

lein run

## Usage

curl http://localhost:3000/<environment>/<key>/<subkey>/...

curl http://localhost:3000/dev/A/B


## Features
- different configuration by environment (development, staging, production).
- hierarchical keys (e.g. A, A/B, A/B/C).
- optional config validation.
- configuration data stored in git repositories.


## TODO
- hierarchical keys in atom
- scheduler stops updating the repo
- clean up naming: branch, version, repo, environment
- configurable repositories (do we store them in git?) every X minutes update the conf file
- backoffice to manage configuration
- security (authentication OAuth?) check CMS TW


## CURRENT ISSUES
- handle errors on updating repos
- if the branch does not exist, no exception is thrown
- git merging strategies fail when repo is already created :(


## NICE TO HAVE
### FEATURES
- on re-loading app, remove directories and start clean
- filter extension files not available
- timbre logger added as a component. add log wrapper? look at pepa project
- key definition in Schema
- git repo security (credentials)
- interesting hybrid model (push with gitconsul and pull REST)
- metrics
- schema coercion
- show historical data
- unit/integration/acceptance testing
- client UI to manage and store data
- client caching strategy (HTTP HEAD, etc)
- versioning: use git tags, or git hash numbers to retrieve specific versions. Not so sure, whether it's so useful, as you would usually be interested on the latest changes. If it's rarely used, it could be implemented just cloning a repo, just for that case. It would take more time to load, but it's a tradeoff.
- use jail component to evaluate clojure schema files like clojail.

### CLOJURE
- use protocol to abstract data store
- yada not used, missing documentation
- Datomic as data store.
- cljx for validation in server and client

### Emacs
- block selection
- magit
- how to jump to clj functions (imenu)


## DOUBTS
- communication between endpoint and data-store through channel? weird.
- 1 channel per repo?
- how to communicate changes to atoms? via fs-watch? or via channel message?
- 1 atom per repo? vs 1 big repo?
- how do I push changes to remote repo with clj-jgit?
- how to validate from local env? using cljx?
- 1 repo per environment vs all environments in 1 repo?
- how to pull files in git repo wihout concurrency issues? 1 scheduled job
- how to debug web app - logging?
- how to autoreload clojure system after a change?
- how to sync config and schema?
- how to store the general config? replicated in all branches? how to keep them sync?
- how flexible are hierarchical keys model?
- does it make sense to expose API to fine grained keys? (e.g. jobs conf, topic2, topic1?
- how to change configuration? git clients? special UI?
- can we build UI from schema definition?
